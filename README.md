## Computer-Vision-Project-1-KU-Leuven-Year-4
This project involved extracting and constructing features from a dataset of faces images with the goal
of training a classification model that will be able to distinguish images of the two target classes from 
eachother and from the look alike faces in the dataset. 

Two seperate classification pipelines, HOG and PCA, were built alongisde some Neural Net, ensemble and combined classifier experimentation.

Project was initially completed as part of a Kaggle competetion and as such Kaggle version control was originally used. Final product has been migrated to git hub
